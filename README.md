## Purpose

Share code that was used to generate the figure in the following open-access research letter:

Wadhwa RR, Rasendran C, Popovic Z, Nissen SE, Desai MY.

## How to reproduce results

We do not have permission to share the underlying dataset (kindly shared by [Retraction Watch](https://retractionwatch.com/)).
Thus, the code will not run unless you acquire the dataset from the Retraction Watch yourself.
Keep in mind that to generate the same figure, you should filter out newer additions to the database.

To preserve the goal of reproducibility as best as we can, we have shared an R markdown document (`boxplot.Rmd`) that explicitly shows the code used to generate the single figure in the original article.
Additionally, we have shared the HTML output of the R markdown document; if you download this HTML document (`boxplot.html`) and open it in a browser on your local machine, you can view the boxplot generated by the R markdown code.

## Dependencies

If you are able to obtain the Retraction Watch dataset and would like to generate the figure with your (possibly newer/updated) copy of the dataset, you will need to install the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/) on your computer along with the [`tidyverse`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tidyverse), [`lubridate`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lubridate), and [`cowplot`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cowplot) packages.
